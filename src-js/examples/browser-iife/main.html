      Add a <script> tag to your page to load the IIFE version of TRP.js
      
      In this example we use the local development version of the library via the dist/ folder
      (which means you'll need to have run `npm run build`!).
    -->
    <script src="../../dist/browser/trp.min.js"></script>
    <!--
      To use the published versions of the library through a CDN like jsDelivr or UNPKG, you might
      set up your tag something like the below.

        <script
          src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/amazon-textract-response-parser@0.4.2"
          integrity="sha384-8Ykws8cWb9e4P0qkOQcsZ3qCam0Q0SbKsGqqVUcqliMQgAH1bkSeTxTTEB9PLUPG"
          crossorigin="anonymous"
        ></script>
      
      or:

        <script
          src="https://unpkg.com/amazon-textract-response-parser@0.4.2"
          integrity="sha384-8Ykws8cWb9e4P0qkOQcsZ3qCam0Q0SbKsGqqVUcqliMQgAH1bkSeTxTTEB9PLUPG"
          crossorigin="anonymous"
        ></script>

      These CDNs should resolve `/dist/browser/trp.min.js` as the default file automatically, but
      you can specify it explicitly at the end of the URL if you prefer. You could check the
      expected integrity hash via a tool like https://www.srihash.org/

  <body>
    <!--
      After loading the TRP script above, the global `window.trp` object should be set for your
      code to use. In this example we've put the example JavaScript in main.js - but you could
      inline it to the <script> tag in this HTML if you prefer:
    -->
    <script src="./main.js"></script>
    <!--
      Browser JavaScript generally can't access the local filesystem for security reasons, so this
      example uses a file upload control which the test runner will automatically operate:
    -->
    <h1>Select an Amazon Textract API response JSON file to analyze</h1>
    <input id="textractJson" type="file" onchange="onFileUpload(this)"/>
  </body>
